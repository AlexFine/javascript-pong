Canvas Pong
===========

This is a small experiment to implement a version of the classic Pong game in an HTML <canvas>.

It has been broken up into parts in order to demonstrate how it was constructed:

Part 1 - Javascript Library
===========================

Part 2 - Basic Game Loop
========================

Part 3 - Keyboard Input
=======================

 * Keyboard Input
 * Bouncing Ball
 * Court Rendering
 * Paddle Rendering
 * Double Buffering
 * Collision Detection
 * Scoring
 * Sound
 * Browser Support


TODO
====
 * Need to 'pause' while alert/confirm instead of just hacking timesetamp

 * THINK MORE CAREFULLY ABOUT ARTICLES
 * Test in older FF to check ECMA5 methods
 * UI to toggle on/off
    - debug
    - footprints
    - prediction
